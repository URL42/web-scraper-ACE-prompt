# OpenAI SDK Experiments

A sandbox of agent prototypes that call the OpenAI API alongside Playwright, Streamlit, and assorted helper scripts. The code base currently contains:

- `smart_scraper_app.py` — Streamlit UI that lets GPT choose a URL, scrape it with Playwright, and answer the user’s question from the captured text.
- `smart_scraper_app2.py` — Variant for iterating on tool-calling prompts without the UI baggage.
- `browser_agent.py` — Voice-enabled browsing agent that drives Chromium with Playwright, maintains a persistent profile, and follows instructions loaded from `prompt_guidelines.json`.
- `watch_scraper_bot.py` — Task runner that watches the `scrapes/` folder and summarizes new captures to `summaries/`.
- `simple_agent.py` — Minimal example of calling the Responses API and logging outputs.

Utility folders:
- `scrapes/`, `summaries/`, and `outputs/` store artifacts generated at runtime.
- `user_profiles/` contains Playwright user data for persistent sessions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Dependencies declared in `requirements.txt` (install with `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- An `OPENAI_API_KEY` in your environment for any script that instantiates `OpenAI()`
- Playwright installed with the Chromium browser for scraping features (`playwright install chromium`)

## Setup
```bash
cd OpenAI_SDK
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium  # once per machine
cp .env.example .env  # if you maintain one
```
Populate environment variables such as:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
DISCORD_WEBHOOK=...
```
Some agents may expect additional keys (see prompts or inline comments for the most current list).

## Running Examples
- Smart scraper UI: `streamlit run smart_scraper_app.py`
- Background scraping / answering: `python smart_scraper_app2.py "What changed on the Notion pricing page?"`
- Browser agent: `python browser_agent.py` (launches an interactive Streamlit dashboard + Playwright browser)
- Watcher bot: `python watch_scraper_bot.py`

Each script logs intermediate artifacts either to stdout or into the folders noted above so you can inspect GPT’s tool calls and responses.
